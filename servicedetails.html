                            Immigrants experience various cultural shocks in their new countries. Some of these cultural shocks end in family trauma and distortion, leading to parental disrespect, spousal estrangements, and, in extreme cases, homicides and heightened social vices that could lead to imprisonment or deportation. Most families for the collectivist cultures find unacceptable the individualist cultures of the west that are quickly embraced by their children, causing friction between parents and children; it's like the erosion of the very principles under which parents brought up their children. 
                            Before or after migration, AmeRIntegrate engages families and groups for person-to-person or group counsel on navigating and integrating their home culture with the host country or community culture.

                            We render consultancy services to governments, groups, corporate organizations, and nonprofits on immigration and immigrant-related matters. Our services include educating individuals and organizations who deal with immigrants about specific characteristics, behavioral patterns, culture, and needs of a group of immigrants. We also render consultancy services to schools through guidance and counsellorship on the management of behavioral attributes of students from a particular country. These services enhance immigrants' and immigrant children's integration with existing students and organizations, including corporate and religious organizations, to achieve cohesion among the groups and capitalize on issues amalgamating their members.

                            Many immigrants are not privy to the public policies guiding their stays and relationship with the government and established community. Even when some learn about the policies, probably from the TVs and radios, they fail to appreciate the implications for their successful co-existence and the impact on their livelihood. Whether before or after arrival in their new countries, AmeRIntegrate delivers lectures on the public policies of the target host countries and communities to enhance the quick integration of immigrants on request by individuals or groups.

                            Many immigrants arrive in their host communities with varying degrees, qualifications, and professional experiences in specific fields. The natural expectation is to use these qualifications and professional experiences in their new countries to expand in their chosen areas. However, they may soon find that their previous education and experiences are not recognized in the countries they immigrated to and that they have to start all over. This possibility of starting over could be the first rude shock that hits immigrants. When they realize that they need to restart their lives, they may rush into some professions and academic pursuits that eventually lead them nowhere. AmeRIntegrate walks with potential and existing immigrants through career paths that would be meaningful and fulfill their immigration dreams. Group training is also available.

                            Governments have diverse provisions to care for the health of immigrants in their new countries per the UNDP Social and Environmental Standards (SES) requirements. These healthcare provisions differ from country to country. However, many immigrants are unaware of what is obtainable in their host countries; therefore, they suffer and sometimes die in ignorance. AmeRIntegrate works with clients to determine the most appropriate and available healthcare facilities to cater to their needs. it also advocates with the government on the critical care areas and challenges encountered by immigrants

                            Most immigrants do not know what their rights and responsibilities are. They, therefore, live in fear while there are provisions by the state to cater for, render support, and sometimes cover their legal costs, irrespective of status. Many immigrants do not know that whether their immigration status is regularized or not, they are protected by the state against abuses; sexual, family, interpersonal, infringements at workplaces, law enforcement brutalities, neighborhood abuses, etc. Some do not know the provisions made by the states to ensure their paths to citizenship; therefore, they miss opportunities because of ignorance. The New Jersey government, for instance, has provisions for educational assistance, grant of driver's license, legal cost assistance, etc., to undocumented immigrants under their office of New Americans. Yet, many of these immigrants are unaware of these provisions. AmeRIntegrate relates requiring immigrants and potential immigrants with legal counselors regarding their rights, duties, and responsibilities, thereby easing their pains in their host communities and with immigration processes. Group immigration counsel, education, webinars, and workshops are available on demand.

                            The west has a way of luring people into various debts. You are a potential for housing, vehicle, furniture, medical, clothing, and even nutritional credit racketeering. The attraction is enormous for immigrants, especially when they do not earn enough to acquire these seeming necessities from their meager earnings. Before long, they find themselves in massive and unanticipated debt, and all sorts of creditors are after them. Their credit rating degenerates to such a level that they cannot obtain additional credits for essential matters. AmeRIntegrate provides personal, family, and group financial services education to clients to help them have healthy financial lives in their host communities.

                            One of the critical issues immigrants face in a new country is housing. There is always confusion about whether to rent or buy. Most times, the immigrant is hindered by the housing and homeownership concept from their home country and, therefore, cannot capitalize on opportunities in their new country. AmeRIntegrate Realtors come in handy in advising and piloting immigrants to the best options in rental and home ownership investments.

                            A crucial aspect of the new horizon for every immigrant is being equipped to accept other cultures and be accepted by them. All immigrant recipient countries have mixed multitudes that come with diverse cultures. Every immigrant must deal with these cultures and the host country's traditional culture. Except an immigrant understands the dynamics of the concept of multiculturalism and can engage cultural intelligence to deal with individuals and groups, they may constantly feel alienated from society. AmeRIntegrate engages individuals, groups, and organizations that deal with multiculturalism, such as governments, NGOs, and corporates, to deliver cutting-edge technologies to overcome cultural shocks and enhance integration.

                            Governments are well intended to fully integrate immigrants to maximize the befits of accepting them into the country. Therefore, governments make immigration and immigrant integration policies to optimize immigrants' potential, enhance socio-economic benefits to the state and individuals and reduce social vices. However, the majority of these policies and visions remain on paper because of non-appreciation of the impacts immigrants can make on the developmental agenda of the government, visionary gaps between the policymakers and implementers, inarticulate and inefficient involvement of immigrants in matters that concern them, and bureaucratic bottlenecks. Gap bridging between policy-making and policy implementation concerning immigrants is a cardinal objective of AmeRIntegrate. Therefore, we consciously engage measures to advocate and assist governments' efficient integration of immigrants.
